Subject: [PATCH 096/154] pvrvideosink: Fix blit rectangle

Blit dest rectangle gets x and y bottom and right coordinates, instead
of width and height. The right value is calculated using the width and
height plus the left and top coordinates respectively. The coordinates
calculated before were only wrong when force-aspect-ratio was set.
