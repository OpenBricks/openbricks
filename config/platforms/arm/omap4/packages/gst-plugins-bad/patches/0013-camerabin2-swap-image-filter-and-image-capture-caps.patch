Subject: [PATCH 013/154] camerabin2: swap image-filter and image-capture-caps

Make it so that the capsfilter controlled by image-capture-caps is linked before
the image-filter element. Makes it more consistent in that image-capture-caps
always filters the output of the camera and can so be used to negotiate with the
camera.
