Upstream-Status:Inappropriate [debian patch]

From: Niko Tyni <ntyni@debian.org>
Subject: Point users to Debian packages of deprecated core modules
Bug-Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/580034

Class::ISA, Switch, Pod::Plainer, and (partially) Shell were
deprecated from the Perl core in 5.12.0.

To get a clean transition, perl-modules is going to recommend the separate
Debian packages of these for one release cycle so that they will be
pulled in by default on upgrades.

However, on systems configured to ignore recommendations the deprecation
warnings will still be useful, so modify them slightly to point to the
separate packages instead.
