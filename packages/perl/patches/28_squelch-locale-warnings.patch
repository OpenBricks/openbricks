Upstream-Status:Inappropriate [debian patch]

From: Niko Tyni <ntyni@debian.org>
Subject: Squelch locale warnings in Debian package maintainer scripts
Bug-Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/508764

The system locales are rather frequently out of sync with the C library
during package upgrades, causing a huge amount of useless Perl locale
warnings. Squelch them when running package maintainer scripts, detected
by the DPKG_RUNNING_VERSION environment variable.

Any real locale problem will show up after the system upgrade too, and
the warning will be triggered normally again at that point.

+On Debian systems, if the DPKG_RUNNING_VERSION environment variable is
+set (to any value), the locale failure warnings will be suppressed just
+like with a zero PERL_BADLANG setting. This is done to avoid floods
+of spurious warnings during system upgrades.
