commit 6695a346c41138df5b2c0e26b9a49b1f96137da0

    make_ext.pl populates @INC correctly, don't override it badly
    
    PERL5LIB is populated by make_ext.pl with paths to the modules we need
    to run, don't override this with "../../lib" since that may not have
    been populated yet in a parallel build.
