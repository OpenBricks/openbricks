PKG_LONGDESC=" This is a set of high-quality TrueType fonts created by Bitstream, Inc. and released under a DFSG-free license. They are intended to remedy the lack of free high-quality fonts for the free desktop environments. They fully cover Western European languages (ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-15) and Turkish (ISO-8859-9). They also include a selection of mathematical and other symbols and some limited support for Eastern European languages (parts of ISO-8859-2). Non-latin scripts are not supported (use ttf-dejavu instead)."
