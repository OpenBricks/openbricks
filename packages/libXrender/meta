PKG_LONGDESC="The X Rendering Extension (Render) introduces digital image composition as the foundation of a new rendering model within the X Window System. Rendering geometric figures is accomplished by client-side tessellation into either triangles or trapezoids.  Text is drawn by loading glyphs into the server and rendering sets of them.  The Xrender library exposes this extension to X clients."
