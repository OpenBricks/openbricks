PKG_LONGDESC="GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by installing new plug-ins."
