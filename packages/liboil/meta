PKG_LONGDESC="Liboil is a collection of functions that often benefit from having special implementations on various architectures or CPUs.  Each function in liboil has several implementations which may perform faster or slower on a given CPU.  Some implementations use alternate algorithms, some use hand-crafted assembly, and some use special instructions that are only available on certain CPUs, such as MMX, SSE, or Altivec. The fastest implementation is automatically chosen at runtime."
