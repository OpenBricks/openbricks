PKG_SHORTDESC="X Keyboard Extension"
PKG_LONGDESC="The X Keyboard Extension essentially replaces the core protocol definition of keyboard. The extension makes possible to clearly and explicitly specify most aspects of keyboard behaviour on per-key basis and to more closely track the logical and physical state of the keyboard. It also includes a number of keyboard controls designed to make keyboards more accessible to people with physical impairments."
