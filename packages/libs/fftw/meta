PKG_LONGDESC="The FFTW library computes Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) in one or more dimensions. It is extremely fast. This package contains the shared library versions of the fftw libraries in single, double and long double precisions. Note that on some architectures double is the same as long double in which case there is no long double library."
