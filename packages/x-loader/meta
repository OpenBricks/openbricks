PKG_LONGDESC="X-loader is a small first stage boot loader derived from the u-boot base code to be loaded into the internal static ram by the OMAP ROM code. Because the internal static ram is very small (64k), xloader is stripped down to the essentials and is used to initialize memory and enough of the peripheral devices to access and load the second stage loader (UBoot) into main memory."
