PKG_LONGDESC="libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction layer on top of video4linux2 devices. The purpose of this (thin) layer is to make it easy for application writers to support a wide variety of devices without having to write separate code for different devices in the same class. libv4l consists of 3 different libraries: libv4lconvert, libv4l1 and libv4l2."
