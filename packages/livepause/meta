PKG_LONGDESC="llivepause accepts input from MPEG2 TS sent over raw UDP, or from a file. It also supports reading an MPEG2 PS from a file or device, this is converted into an MPEG2 TS stream internally. livepause serves the stored MPEG2 TS via either raw TCP or a very simple HTTP server. By using TCP/HTTP it allows the application to pause the stream simply by not reading from the socket."
