PKG_SHORTDESC="small boot splash screen for Linux"
PKG_LONGDESC="dietsplash is a small boot splash screen for Linux. Its aim is to do the minimal work possible so you can see your system booting without getting bored about the messages going on (or better, your client doesn’t complain to you that it’s ugly to see all those messages). Its main target is embedded systems, where running a full/big splash like plymouth is an overkill. Special attention is given to keep it small: as of now, it produces a binary of just 14KB without images and 34KB using the images that come as example bundled into the binary."
