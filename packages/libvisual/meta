PKG_LONGDESC=" Libvisual is a generic visualization framework that allows applications to easily access and manage visualization plugins. Audio visualization is the process of making pretty moving images that are correlated in some way to the audio currently being played by a media player.  Most audio visualization is tied to a specific application or media player, making it difficult to share code. Libvisual allows applications to use existing visualization plugins written for the libvisual framework."
