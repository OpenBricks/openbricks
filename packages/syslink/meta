PKG_SHORTDESC="TI OMAP4 SysLink DSP interface"
PKG_LONGDESC="SysLink is the next generation IPC driver developed for OMAP4 and beyond. SysLink  is an evolution of both the previous-generation IPC drivers - DSPBridge and DSPLink. It provides a symmetric IPC interface on both the host processor and remote/slave processors. It is easily scalable to support more than 2 processors. SysLink provides features to control and communicate with slave processors enabling parallel processing for multimedia acceleration. SysLink integrates with D-OMX enabling MPU to offload some OMX components to slave processors."
