PKG_SHORTDESC="squashfs: A compressed read-only filesystem for Linux"
PKG_LONGDESC="Squashfs is intended to be a general read-only filesystem, for archival use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in constrained block device/memory systems (e.g. embedded systems) where low overhead is needed. The filesystem is currently stable and has been tested on PowerPC, i386, SPARC and ARM architectures."
