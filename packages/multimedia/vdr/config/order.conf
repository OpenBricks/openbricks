# If you like a fixed plugin order in your menu place the plugin base names
# here. Remember that the first entry a plugin may get, starts at five in
# VDR's OSD.
#
# If you want a certain Plugin not to be loaded automatically at
# vdr-startup, then you can simply write "-pluginname" in this file.
#
# If you want to append some plugins behind all the other plugins, then youi
# can write "*pluginname" in this file.
#
# If you want to add commandline-options for a certain plugin, this file is
# not the right place - you can add them in the file(s)
# /etc/vdr/plugins/plugin.<pluginname>.conf - each option in one line
