# VDR Recording Action Script  - Tobias Grimm <tg@e-tobi.net>
# ---------------------------
#
# This script gets executed by VDR before a recording starts, after a
# recording ends and after a recording has been edited.
# In order to allow other addons to hook into this process, this script will
# search for any executables in /usr/share/vdr/recording-hooks. These
# hooks are called in their alphabetical order and should follow this
# naming scheme:
#
# R<XX>.<identifier>
#
# Where <XX> is a two digit number, that mainly specifies the execution order
# and <identifier> is a unique descriptor.
#
# Two parameters are passed to each recording hook:
#
# Parameter 1 can have the values "before", "after" and "edited", depending
# on whether the recording hook is called before the recording starts,
# after the recording ends or after the recording has been edited.
#
# Parameter 2 is the directory of the recording. Be aware, that this directory
# doesn't exist before the recording starts.
