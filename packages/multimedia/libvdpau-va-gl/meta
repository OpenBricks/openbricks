PKG_SHORTDESC="The VDPAU driver with VA-API/OpenGL backend"
PKG_LONGDESC="There are applications exists that can use VDPAU. Amongst them are Adobe Flash Player and Mplayer. They both can use VDPAU, but since there is no VDPAU available on Intel chips, they fall back to different drawing techniques. And while Mplayer can use XVideo extension to offload scaling to GPU, Flash Player can not and does all scaling in software. If there was VDPAU available, CPU usage could be significantly lower."
