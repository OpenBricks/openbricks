#The plugin requires a valid network connection with a IPv4 address. It will find
#its settings automatically by default. In this case, the first network device in
#the network device list with a valid IPv4 address and port 49152 will be used
#for connections. You can change this behavior either by setting the command line
#options or by editing the setup via the VDRs setup page. The command line
#options have a higher priority and substitute the menu settings.

#The command line settings are:
#  -i <interface>  --int=<interface>     The server network
#                                        interface
#                                        e.g: eth0, wlan1 etc.
#                                        If given option '-a' must
#                                        be absent.
#  -a <address>    --address=<address>   The server IPv4 address.
#                                        If given option '-i' must
#                                        be absent.
#  -p <port>       --port=<port>         The server port
#                                        Supported ports:
#                                        0           (auto detect)
#                                        49152-65535 (user defined)
#  -d              --autodetect          Force auto detection
#                                        Use this option to
#                                        overwrite the setup menu
#                                        options.
#  -v              --verbose             Increase verbosity level
#                                        The more v options the
#                                        higher the output level
#                  --dbdir=<directory>   The directory in which the
#                                        metadata database is stored
#                  --httpdir=<directory> The directory where the
#                                        http documents are located
#
#The verbose option can be more than once. With each option the verbosity level
#will be increased. The maximum level is 5. Further options are silently ignored.
#
#
#  -v                                  Print most important messages
#  -vv                                 Print messages from the components
#                                      i.e. the webserver, CDS, CMS, etc.
#  -vvv                                Print messages from receivers and players
#                                      and other additional components
#  -vvvv                               You can't get enough, hum?
#                                      This will print SQL messages and DIDL
#                                      messages
#  -vvvvv                              Can you read the matrix? You can't?
#                                      Then try first reading SQL statements,
#                                      fetches, buffer and parser outputs or
#                                      any other outputs.
#
#If not options are set, menu options will be used.
