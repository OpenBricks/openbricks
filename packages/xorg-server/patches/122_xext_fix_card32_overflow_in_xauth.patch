Description:  Xext: "xauth generate" with large timeout crashes Xorg #27134
 The security timout CARD32 millis would overflow with large timeouts, causing 
 the timer callback to be called immediately and hit an assertion in
 SecurityAuthorizationExpired.
 .
 This has not been applied upstream yet.  Discussion of the patch faltered
 without resolution.  This patch has a problem when the epoch time is
 sufficiently far in the future (about 2035) that it doesn't matter right now.
