PKG_LONGDESC="Most OSes have SCSI pass-through interfaces that enable user space programs to send SCSI commands to a device and fetch the response. With SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT) many ATA disks now can process SCSI commands. Typically each utility in this package implements one SCSI command. See the draft standards at www.t10.org for SCSI command definitions plus SAT. ATA commands are defined in the draft standards at www.t13.org . For a mapping between supported SCSI and ATA commands and utility names in this package see the COVERAGE file"
