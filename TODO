- Subpackages support: one src pkg -> multiple binary pkgs
 + pkg name will be parent:sub (e.g. xine-lib:vdpau ).
 + still one unique installdev file
 + multiple meta/install files, e.g. meta.sub and install.sub
 + could inherit some properties from parent meta file.

- syslinux revision number (boot prompt) is no longer updated (depends on build date)
 + modify rootfs content in postprocess script ?

- Build debug packages
 + same as runtime pkg but with debugging symbols
 + not meant to include extra binaries for debugging purpose
 + Build all pkgs with -O2 -g flag
 + create *-dbg pkg (runtime + dev)
  * install to .install-dgb
  * use strip -o to place the stripped binaries in .install
  * use strip --only-keep-debug to make the stuff in .install-dbg debug-only

- Add external toolchain support
 + do not build gcc/binutils/glibc/... packages
 + use gcc --sysroot option to specify a new LIB_PREFIX ?

- Add some script to easily generate patches from current build tree

- Create a "geexbox-config.opk" package at builds end.
 + Must contain only configuration files for /etc
 + Must contain user custom settings
 + Generated by build script or generator
 + Must be no-arch
 + Can't be updated by opkg update, as not part of any repository
 + All packages init scripts are just expected to read their config from
   the /etc/user_defaults/* files contained within and adapt their init script
   based on that

- Add a store/repository for "opkg update/install" for releases.

- Add multiple ARM architectures support (5/6/7).
 + update build.$arch accordingly and opkg filenames.

- Add download mirror feature.
 + if set, all tarballs get retrieved from this location
 + useful with multiple developers on same site, with restricted WAN.
