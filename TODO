- syslinux revision number (boot prompt) is no longer updated (depends on build date)
 + modify rootfs content in postprocess script ?

- Add some script to easily generate patches from current build tree

- Create a "geexbox-config.opk" package at builds end.
 + Must contain only configuration files for /etc
 + Must contain user custom settings
 + Generated by build script or generator
 + Must be no-arch
 + Can't be updated by opkg update, as not part of any repository
 + All packages init scripts are just expected to read their config from
   the /etc/user_defaults/* files contained within and adapt their init script
   based on that

- Add a store/repository for "opkg update/install" for releases.

- write docs
 + how to add a new package
 + complete meta file syntax
 + what to do if one changes use flags
 + how to add a new custom platform
 + how to use distro flavors
 + how booting and installation process actually works

- have generic per-platform kernel config files
 + disable (sed) features through kconfig (e.g. USB/DVB/iptables/IPv6/...)

- add a configure like entry
 + defconfig only probably won't be manageable
 + allow selecting hardware platform (if any, or generic arch)
 + allow selecting distro flavor (mini, geexbox, ...)
 + generate a default config file based on this
 + eventually some key features: x11/embedded (a.k.a. old "console" mode)

- add an SGX use flag
 + to be specified by each ARM platform using PowerVR SGX GPU.
 + ensure evas uses it for GLES
 + do not install SGX OMAP34xx drv and libs on platform != omap3

- ensure all runtime packages get stripped
 + those not using make_install aren't
 + e.g.(e)glibc

- add support for embedded-oriented filesystems
 + JFFS2 / UBIFS / YAFFS
 + kernel drivers + uspace tools (mtd-tools and such).

- upgrade Xorg to 1.9
 + match to Ubuntu's version
 + adapt xf86-video-v4l2 + xf86-video-pvr (OMAP4) from Maverick

- add target image generation
 + pack rootfs in jffs2 / yaffs / ubifs binary.
 + ready to be flashed on NAND.
