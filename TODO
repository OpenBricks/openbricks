- syslinux revision number (boot prompt) is no longer updated (depends on build date)
 + modify rootfs content in postprocess script ?

- Add some script to easily generate patches from current build tree

- Create a "geexbox-config.opk" package at builds end.
 + Must contain only configuration files for /etc
 + Must contain user custom settings
 + Generated by build script or generator
 + Must be no-arch
 + Can't be updated by opkg update, as not part of any repository
 + All packages init scripts are just expected to read their config from
   the /etc/user_defaults/* files contained within and adapt their init script
   based on that

- Add a store/repository for "opkg update/install" for releases.

- have generic per-platform kernel config files
 + disable (sed) features through kconfig (e.g. USB/DVB/iptables/IPv6/...)

- ensure all runtime packages get stripped
 + those not using make_install aren't
 + e.g.(e)glibc

- NextGen branch:
 + lirc in-kernel/evdev
   - drop lirc-nct667x, use nuvoton-cir instead
   - review module names for all lirc configs
   - investigate lirc modules autoload via udev
 + systemd instead of upstart
   - write documentation (http://0pointer.de/public/systemd-man/ can help)
   - proper aufs umount on shutdown
     (http://aufs.sourceforge.net/aufs.html#Incompatible with an Ordinary Filesystem)
   - write systemd units for all packages
   - add default.target selection in Kconfig
   - add systemd targets for all supported frontends (cf xbmc.target), so that
     we can directly boot into a frontend by setting it as default.target or by
     passing systemd.unit=mediacenter.target on kernel cmdline
   - implement console setup: either
     - adapt systemd-vconsole (disabled for now) for busybox loadkmap
     - package kbd (http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kbd/) and use that
       instead of busybox loadkmap/setfont
     - port kbd loadkeys to busybox
   - port some util-linux-ng extensions to busybox
     - hwclock --systz
     - fsck -l
     - agetty -s
   - implement socket activation for busybox syslogd and acpid
     (http://0pointer.de/public/systemd-man/daemon.html)
 + multiuser
   - add default root password setting in Kconfig
   - implement a way for packages to add users/groups (one solution could be
     password.d and groups.d in package dir, like we do for tmpfiles.d)
   - install package files with proper user/group and permissions
   - run as much as possible as non-root like other distros do
 + network daemons
   - add Kconfig settings for default credentials and access restrictions
   - kill old settings in /etc/network and only enable by default the daemons 
     actually enabled in Kconfig
   - start samba & co only when the network is online
 + kill useless configurator and let user to modify cfg
 + rework installator for simple squashfs -> hdd expansion
   (keeping kernel + initrd)
 + kill grub and use extlinux instead
    (see http://blog.daniel-baumann.ch/2011/01/07 )
 + then switch to app level again
