- syslinux revision number (boot prompt) is no longer updated (depends on build date)
 + modify rootfs content in postprocess script ?

- Add some script to easily generate patches from current build tree

- Create a "geexbox-config.opk" package at builds end.
 + Must contain only configuration files for /etc
 + Must contain user custom settings
 + Generated by build script or generator
 + Must be no-arch
 + Can't be updated by opkg update, as not part of any repository
 + All packages init scripts are just expected to read their config from
   the /etc/user_defaults/* files contained within and adapt their init script
   based on that

- Add a store/repository for "opkg update/install" for releases.

- have generic per-platform kernel config files
 + disable (sed) features through kconfig (e.g. USB/DVB/iptables/IPv6/...)

- ensure all runtime packages get stripped
 + those not using make_install aren't
 + e.g.(e)glibc

- NextGen branch:
 + kernel upgrade
 + driver port + lirc in-kernel/evdev
 + squashfs + aufs
 + systemd instead of upstart
 + multiuser
 + kill useless configurator and add a friendly nano editor
   for user to modify cfg
 + rework installator for simple squashfs -> hdd expansion
   (keeping kernel + initrd)
 + kill grub and use extlinux instead
    (see http://blog.daniel-baumann.ch/2011/01/07 )
 + then switch to app level again
