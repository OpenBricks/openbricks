Adding a new distribution flavour
=================================

Distribution flavours are defined in config/flavours/$flavour. To add a new flavour 'example' you can follow these instructions:

. mkdir config/flavours/example
. create config/flavours/example/meta with a text editor, with the following
  contents:

[source,sh]
FLAVOUR_NAME=example
FLAVOUR_DISTRONAME="Example Flavour"
FLAVOUR_DEPENDS=""
FLAVOUR_USE=""
FLAVOUR_SHORTDESC="my example flavour"
FLAVOUR_LONGDESC="a detailed description of my example flavour"

. add the list of packages you want to select in your flavour to
  FLAVOUR_DEPENDS; have a look at the existing flavours (especially 'base',
  which is a minimal console-only system) for examples of package combinations
. optionally, add arch-specific packages to FLAVOUR_DEPENDS_$arch
. optionally, add platform-specific packages to FLAVOUR_DEPENDS_$arch_$platform
. add the list of features (i.e. use flags) you want to enable to FLAVOUR_USE
. optionally, add a BusyBox configuration file as busybox.conf to customize
  BusyBox configuration

After creating the meta file, the new flavour will be available for selection
in the OpenBricks configuration system. If you believe your flavour can be of
general usage we encourage you to submit it to the OpenBricks mailing list for
review and inclusion in the upstream tree.
