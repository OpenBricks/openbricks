Adding a new platform
=====================

Platforms are defined in config/plaform/$arch/$platform. To add support for a 
new platform, you should copy the 'generic' platform for your arch:
  cp -PR config/plaform/myarch/generic config/plaform/myarch/myplatform
and edit Kconfig to change the platform settings:

. change the entry symbol to TARGET_PLATFORM_myarch_myplatform
. depend on TARGET_ARCH_myarch
. optionally add 'select' lines for packages you require (e.g.
   platform-specific drivers

At this point you have to decide if you want to use the OpenBricks kernel or
a vendor-supplied kernel. In the first case, you can add arch-specific patches
to packages/linux/patches or, if they break other archs/platforms, to
config/plaform/myarch/myplatform/packages/linux/patches. You should also add a
tuned kernel config for your platform as linux.conf in the platform directory.

If you want to use a vendor kernel, you need to override the 'linux' and 
'linux-headers' packages. Create config/plaform/myarch/myplatform/packages/linux/meta
with PKG_VERSION and PKG_URL pointing to your kernel, and
config/plaform/myarch/myplatform/packages/linux-headers/meta with a matching
PKG_VERSION.

If your platform uses u-boot, you can add platform-specific bootargs to
config/plaform/myarch/myplatform/boot.cfg.
