OpenBricks Supported Platforms
==============================

Supported Hardware Architectures
--------------------------------

The OpenBricks framework aims are enabling embedded Linux distribution creation
for as much hardware architectures as possible. It currently supports at least
the following ones:

* ARM:
 ** ARMv7 (Cortex-A9) with NEON extensions such as TI OMAP4.
 ** ARMv7 (Cortex-A9) such as nVidia Tegra250.
 ** ARMv7 (Cortex-A8) with NEON extensions such as TI OMAP3.
 ** ARMv6 (ARM11) with VFP extensions such as Broadcom BCM11107.
 ** ARMv5 (ARM9) such as Marvell Kirkwood.
* x86:
 ** 32 and 64 bits
 ** From i586 to Core-i7.
* PowerPC
* MIPS

Available Platforms
-------------------

A platform, in OpenBricks terminology, is a subset of a given hardware
architecture. It can vary from a specific SoC or microprocessor brand,
to a dedicated embedded board. Each platform may have some specific
configuration and tuning, either hardware or software but, once certified to
work with OpenBricks, it means that every owner of such a platform is ensured
that the OpenBricks project will run on it.

The OpenBricks project is continuously trying to support as much platforms as possible and donating / sponsoring is the best way to have new ones being supported. The exhaustive list of supported platforms can be found *config/platform/$arch* directory.

So far, the OpenBricks project is available on the following platforms:

* ARM
 ** *bcmring*: Broadcom BCM11107 evaluation boards.
 ** *kirkwood*: All Marvell Kirkwood-equipped boards such as OpenRD.
 ** *omap3*: All TI OMAP3-equipped boards, including BeagleBoard, Zoom2 and IGEPv2.
 ** *omap4*: All TI OMAP4-equipped boards, including PandaBoard.
 ** *qemu*: A QEMU-compatible platform using ARM Versatile architecture.
 ** *tegra2*: All nVidia Tegra250-equipped boards, including Harmony evaluation board.
* i386
 ** *generic*: 32 bits x86 i586+ PCs.
 ** *vmware*: 32bits x86 VMware-optimized virtual machine.
* mips
 ** *generic*: 32bits MIPS.
* powerpc
 ** *generic*: 32bits PowerPC G3 Macintosh.
* powerpc64
 ** *generic*: 64bits PowerPC G5 Macintosh.
* x86_64
 ** *generic*: 64bits x86 AMD64 / Intel PCs.
 ** *ion*: 64bits x86 nVidia ION systems.
 ** *vmware*: 64bits x86 VMware-optimized virtual machine.

Certified Platforms
-------------------

While OpenBricks runs natively on all x86 computers, the ARM/PowerPC/MIPS embedded space is obviously another story.

So far, the OpenBricks project has been tested, evaluated and certified with the following embedded platforms that we own:
