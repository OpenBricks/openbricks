Adding a new machine
====================

Machines are defined per-platform in config/plaform/$arch/$platform/machines. 
To add support for a new machine, you should copy an existing machine definition
(such as the 'generic' machine for your arch):
  cp -PR config/plaform/myarch/myplatform/machines/generic config/plaform/myarch/myplatform/machines
and edit meta to change the machine settings.

At this point you have to decide if you want to use the OpenBricks kernel or
a vendor-supplied kernel. In the first case, you can add arch-specific patches
to packages/linux/patches or, if they break other archs/platforms, to
config/plaform/myarch/myplatform/packages/linux/patches. You should also add a
tuned kernel config for your platform as linux.conf in the platform directory.

If you want to use a vendor kernel, you need to override the 'linux' and 
'linux-headers' packages. Create config/plaform/myarch/myplatform/packages/linux/meta
with PKG_VERSION and PKG_URL pointing to your kernel, and
config/plaform/myarch/myplatform/packages/linux-headers/meta with a matching
PKG_VERSION.

If your machine uses u-boot, you can add machine-specific bootargs to
config/plaform/myarch/myplatform/machines/mymachine/boot.cfg.
