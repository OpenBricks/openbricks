Pick your device, select your software bricks and cook your product !

Who is it for ?
---------------

Individuals and companies that look for rapid board bring-up with fine-grain
embedded Linux distribution setup with complete customization.
Ever had to care about BSP and toolchain ? That's now long gone history.
If time to market means for you, OpenBricks will save your day.

Which hardware is supported ?
-----------------------------

OpenBricks supports a broad range of embedded partners (including but not
limited to Intel, TI, nVidia, Freescale, Broadcom and Marvell) and SoC,
from low-end MIPS to high-end ARM Cortex-A9 MP through Intel ATOM.
Whether you're designing a smartphone, a SetTopBox, a NAS or a router,
OpenBricks can optimize your code for multi-cores SMP, multi-threaded SMT,
hardware cryptographic accelerators, various DSPs and SIMD extensions.

What does the software offer ?
------------------------------

OpenBricks reduces development efforts by abstracting the low-level interface
to your device. It supports all Khronos industry standards (OpenGL|ES, OpenVG,
OpenMAX ...) and major applicative frameworks (Qt, GTK+, EFL, SDL) for you to
only focus on your end-user application.

Who's using it ?
----------------

OpenBricks is an OpenSource framework. It's the masterpiece framework behind
your next design product. Anyone can use it and contribute to it, individuals
as well as professionals. OpenBricks currently sustains the GeeXboX project.
