Adding a new package
====================

Packages are defined in packages/$package. To easily add a new package you can
use the 'newpackage' tool, which will create a skeleton package template for
you to fill in. Simply run
  ./scripts/newpackage hello
to create a package for the 'hello' program. The script will create a new
'hello' directory under packages. To quickly package your software:

. fill in the meta file fields, starting from PKG_VERSION and PKG_URL;
. run './scripts/unpack hello' to make sure package download is ok, and
  check for the presence of 'hello-$PKG_VERSION' directory in $BUILD;
. check packages/hello/build, and add additional configure options to the
  do_configure call; for packages not using GNU autotools you may have to
  do more extensive customizations;
. run './scripts/build hello' and make sure the package builds with no errors;
. check $BUILD/hello-$PKG_VERSION/.install to see which programs/libraries
  should be installed in the target system;
. edit packages/hello/install to select the files to install to the target
  system;
. if you are packaging a library, edit packages/hello/installdev to select
  the files that should be installed in toolchain; otherwise remove the file;
. run './scripts/clean hello' to clean the package
. try to select the package in the configuration system and build an image 
  with it
