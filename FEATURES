GeeXboX
~~~~~~~

GeeXboX is a free and Open Source Linux distribution for embedded devices
and desktop computers. GeeXboX is not an application, it's a full-featured OS,
that one can boot as a LiveCD, from a USB key, an SD/MMC card or install on its
regular HDD.

The GeeXboX distribution is lightweight and designed for one single goal:
embed all major multimedia applications as to turn your computer into an HTPC.
