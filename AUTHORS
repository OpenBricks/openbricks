Special thanks to George Pratt <george@hosting365.ie> and
  Stephen McCarron <stephen@hosting365.ie> and their company Hosting365
  for offering us a dedicated webserver and full of bandwidth since Dec. 2005.

Thanks for all of the generous donators who have contributed to help us with
project's development by providing us hardware or money.
They are too many to be listed here but each of them will recognize himself.
